Cellular Autamaton Plan

Basic

- Generate rule 30

Conversion

- convert binary strings “0110110100101” into an array of variables (binary or integers and back again)

- conversion of binary to decimal and back again

Files

- saving output into a text file and loading it
- look at the results to

User Input

- Allow the user to select different lengths of the first generation

- Allow the user to select the number of generations to produce

- Allow the user to create the first generation

Random

- Randomly generate rules other than rule 30

Other

- Wrap the ends of the autotmata array around so that the right hand end continues to the lefst hand end ????

Further Extensions

- Implement Conway’s game of life

- Develop another 2D automaton

- Wrap around all the sides so that it forms a 3D tourus
